Whenever a new function or a function change is suggested:

- Outline a clear, step-by-step implementation plan

- Enumerate all possible modifications or impacts that the change may introduce.


And meanwhile:

- await explicit agreement

- Only after approval has been granted, begin writing and integrating the actual code.
